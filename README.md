The General Opinion is an amnesty of thoughts, feeling and emotions about art. It allows anyone with an internet connection, and an impetus, to share their opinions on an often contentious and polarising topic. Taking inspiration from election set-ups and the digital world of communication, The General Opinion aims to provoke and record discussions on art, building a database of opinions which will be available as a resource for anyone and any purpose.
